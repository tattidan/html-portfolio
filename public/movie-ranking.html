<h1>The Best Movies According to Tatti</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>The third Harry Potter movie is probably the best in the entire series. Because he talks about the teenage period of personality formation.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>And every time you start watching the trilogy again, it's again quite difficult to break away.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Yehh, it's a series. From the very first minutes of watching the series, I fell into the soul. Its atmosphere, political intrigues and just the relationship of the characters.</p>
